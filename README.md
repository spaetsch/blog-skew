# blog-skew
This is a layout sample I created to accompany a blog post about CSS skew transforms.

You can read the post at [www.sarahpaetsch.com/blog](http://www.sarahpaetsch.com/blog/index.php/2016/07/29/using-css-transforms-to-create-a-slanted-layout/).

The layout is posted on its own at [skewed-contact.surge.sh/](http://skewed-contact.surge.sh/).
